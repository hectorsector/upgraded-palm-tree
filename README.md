# Welcome to the Use Dependabot exercise!

⚠️ This repository contains an intentional vulnerability. The JQuery package being referenced is vulnerable. Do **not** update this dependency in the template repo as it is necessary for this exercise.

This is an exercise to check your knowledge on using Dependabot to automatically fix vulnerable dependencies in your repository. It is automatically graded via a workflow once you have completed the instructions.

## About this exercise

:warning: A grading script exists under `.github/workflows/grading.yml`. You do not need to use this workflow for any purpose and **altering its contents will affect the repository's ability to assess your exercise and give feedback.**

:warning: This exercise utilizes [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions), which is free for public repositories and self-hosted runners, but may incur charges on private repositories. See _[About billing for GitHub Actions]_ to learn more.

:information_source: The use of GitHub Actions also means that it may take the grading workflow a few seconds and sometimes minutes to run.

## Troubleshooting

The troubleshooter will either display useful information to help you understand what you might have done wrong in your exercise or redirect you to the documentation relevant to your exercise to help you out.
